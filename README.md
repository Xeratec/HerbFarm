# Herb Farm
Automated herb farm running on a ESP32 microcontroller with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth. 
Planned is to monitor the ambient light, temperature, humidity, soil moisture and various water levels in the reservoir collection basin.
The integrated pump should automatically supply the plants with the right amount of water to allow the longest possible runtime without the need of a water refill.

## Project Structure
- `docs`    additional documentation
- `esp32`   firmware for esp32
- `server`  scripts and files for the back- and front-end server
